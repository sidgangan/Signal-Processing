Building "libtensorflow-lite.a"

Clone tensorflow repo
Go to path "/tensorflow/tensorflow/lite/tools/make"
Run file "download_dependencies.sh" : this will download the flatbuffers and other required headers
Run file "build_lib.sh" : this will build the lib for linux machine in folder "gen"

Tips:
1. Copy "tensorflow/tensorflow/lite/tools/make/downloads/flatbuffers/include/flatbuffers" to "tensorflow/flatbuffers" : this helps while running the tflite code

2. For using tflite the directory structure should be :
	-all codes
	-tensorflow
		-flatbuffers
		-tensorflow
			-lite
	
	other than "lite" all other folders can be deleted
